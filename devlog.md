I have never built an API and have done research on how to build one. I will be completing a basic tutorial from Lynda.com before starting my project. 
I was able to download node, express, and docker successfully and start my instance of MongoDB.

Was not able to work on the project.

I created the project under Node-API and installed the node-modules that I would need. 
I was able to get the express server up and running without any issues. 
I had trouble with the mongoose.connect() method, but was able to figure out the issue with the mongoose documentation. 
I used the mongoose documentation to figure out how to connect and create a schema for my api and also used that to troubleshoot the authentication issues that I was having. 
I created two model files, categories and tasks, but was only able to get the task file written today.

I used Postman to check my work from yesterday and make sure that the requests were working. 
The schmema that I have created is not being used in the post method. I am not sure what is wrong and have looked through the documentation on mongoose. I have also searched through some forums to see how other's have solved the issue. After several hours, I was unable to figure out where I was going wrong.
